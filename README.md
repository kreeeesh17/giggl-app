Connectly is a full-stack language learning app that enables users to connect with native speakers via real-time chat and video calls. Built with the MERN stack and deployed on Render, it ensures smooth peer-to-peer communication and responsive design.

The video calling feature is implemented using **WebRTC** along with the **Media Stream API** to allow camera and audio streaming.
